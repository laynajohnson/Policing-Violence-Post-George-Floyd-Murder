# Policing Violence Post George Floyd Murder
The purpose of this project is to examine the use of force by the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) in Minneapolis, Minnestoa. 

## Description

The focus of our research is to see how violence committed by the Minneapolis Police Department has developed since George Floydâ€™s murder. Following the report published by the Minneapolis Department of Human Rights, we wanted to do our own study into police use of force and the various ways this has historically played out after witnessing firsthand the protests that swept the city following the exposure of the MPD in the case of George Floyd. Though our database included information from the years 2008 until 2022, we narrowed our data to be from the years 2019-2021 for most of our analysis. We first looked at the amount of 911 calls that happened in each precinct, then looked at the top 3 forms of force used by police officers and cross referenced it with race. Finally, we looked at the types of resistance that was exhibited by the victim and cross referenced it with race as well.
